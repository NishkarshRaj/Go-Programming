# Introduction to Go Programming

Go programming language was developed at Google in November 2009, to have all the features of C programming language but making the programming:
* Simple
* Reliable
* Efficient

Like C, it is statically and strongly typed.
It is constructed using packages and can have associated dependencies that can be efficiently managed.

It was developed by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson in 2007 to improve the working of C language by providing huge support to programmers via built-in functions created and updated in libraries maintained at Go programming repository at Git open for contribution by the entire programming community.

**Basic improvements provided by Golang over C include the following:**

* Garbage collection
* Type safety
* dynamic typing capability
* advanced built in data types like (key,value) pairs
* supports CSP-style programming for concurrent systems

## Features of Go programming

1. Fast compilation speed
2. Inbuilt support for concurrency
3. Programs are consice and simple
4. produces native statically linked libraries internally
5. Supports adaptive environment features similar to dynamic languages to support portability.
6. Support for interfaces
7. Support for type embedding

## Features not supported in Go programming

Many features of common languages like C++ and Java are not supported in Golang to keep it simple and concise. 
Some of the features not supported are:

1. Type inheritance
2. Overloading
3. support for Pointers
4. Assertions
5. Generic programming
6. Circular dependencies among packages
